/**
 * POST /api/admin/import-roster-spreadsheet
 * Cluster Head or HOD. Parses an uploaded faculty or student roster
 * (.csv / .xlsx / the ERP's HTML .xls),
 * creates Supabase Auth accounts, links students to their mentor and
 * records the batch (successes and per-row failures) for the audit trail.
 *
 * Body: {
 *   import_type: 'faculty' | 'student',
 *   filename: string,
 *   file_base64: string,
 *   semester_cycle_id?: uuid,
 *   default_mentor_id?: uuid,      // fallback when a row has no Mentor Email
 *   create_accounts?: boolean,     // false = dry run / validation only
 *   offset?: number,               // first row of this chunk (see below)
 *   batch_id?: uuid                // the history row chunk 0 created
 * }
 *
 * CHUNKING
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every account is a round trip to Supabase Auth, and the function is
 * capped at 30 seconds (vercel.json), so a 2,700-row roster cannot be
 * done in one request — it used to run out of time partway and leave a
 * few hundred accounts behind with nothing to say which.
 *
 * So a request works through the file until its time is nearly up and
 * returns the row it stopped at; the browser posts the same file back
 * with that offset until there is nothing left. The stopping point is
 * decided by the clock rather than a row count, so it adapts to however
 * fast Auth is answering instead of guessing at a safe batch size.
 *
 * Nothing is kept between requests: existing accounts are re-read at the
 * top of each one, so a chunk sees everything its predecessors created,
 * and re-running a finished import simply reports every row as "already
 * existed".
 *
 * Within a request the rows are created a few at a time rather than one
 * after another, because almost all of the elapsed time is spent waiting
 * on Auth rather than doing anything. Deciding what to do with a row
 * stays strictly in order — that is what notices the same address twice
 * in one file — and only the account creation itself is overlapped.
